# androidbackgroundgps
This repository contains the updated code for the older backgroundgps project. This project is built using Android Studio and contains WebFiles to save the location data in the database. Please note, this is just a sample.

Run gps as a service in background like when the application is installed it starts and periodically send the coordinates to web server

Notes:-
  1. You will need Google Maps for Android API Key to be added to this project
  2. You will need a webserver which will periodically collect the location being sent from the application.
  3. The webFile folder contains two example files for the webserver.
  4. You will have to update the track URL as per your requirements. This track URL is the endpoint for your PHP file which is responsible to fetch Data from the android apps.
